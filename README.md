# Complex Fourier Series
Basically, it is an approximation of an SVG using harmonically spinning circles, each circle spins around at the same frequency with its own constant radius. When you add them tip to tale and let the last point draw on the canvas, they approximate the SVG. Experiment with different number of circles, scale and speed. With follow mode you can follow the "pencil" and then increase the scale, make sure to decrease the speed and enjoy the complexity.
